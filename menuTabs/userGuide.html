      <summary>Create Michi Cards!</summary>
      This section will guide you through easy use of the app, with clear directions.<br>
      To create a New Michi Card, press the 'Create Michi Card <i class="fa-solid fa-cat"></i>' option.<br>
      It is the first option on the main menu.<br>
      You'll instantly see a Cool kitten wearing sunglasses, and the Form to create your own Michi Card!<br>
      <span class="hey"> The only essential requirement on the form to create the card is to write Michi's
        name.</span><br>
      The name must be a maximum of 9 characters. Choose the name that seems funniest or cutest to you.<br>
      You can write a description about the feline in the 'How is the Michi' section, in 125 characters (including
      spaces) or less. If you don't write anything, no problem, some feline deity will grant the Michi they divine
      personality.<br>
      The Michi Card's stats range from 1 to 100. The initial value of each stat is 1, and can be changed as desired.
      <span class="hey">If this number is left as is, the app will choose a random value (between 1 and 100) for that
        stat.</span><br><br>
        For the image of the card You have two options:<br>
      <details>
      <summary>Use your own photo</summary>
      You can take a photo with your device pressing the 'select file' button, bellow the 'Load your own photo!' text.<br>
      Try to put the face of your Michi in the upper section of the photo to have better results.<br>
      <span class="hey">IMPORTANT!</span> The photo you take with your device is NOT saved anywhere by default, neither in the server or client file system.
      </details>
      or<br>
      <details>
      <summary>Use a random photo obtained by the app</summary>
      Just press 'Preview Your Michi' button to see the kitty cat photo that will be in the new Card.
      </details>

        class="fa-solid fa-shield-cat"></i><br>

      <summary>Feral cards</summary>
      What is a Feral Card?<br>
      A Feral Card is one that is different from the 'regular' card created with the app.
      The 'regular' Michi Cards have a specific design: Pink background, Michi's name and double border of the card in black, and
      the only icon on the card is <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-cat"></i><br>
      When the Michi Card is created, a random number is generated between 0 and 1000. If this number is less than or
      equal to 976, You will have a beautiful 'regular' card, but...<br>
      ...if it is greater than 976 you obtain a 'Half Star' type Feral Card. This type of card is very similar to the
      'regulars', but its background is Red and a 'Half Star' icon appears next to the Michi's name <i
        class="fa-solid fa-star-half-stroke"></i><br>
      The probability of obtaining one of these cards is 2.39% each time a Michi Card is created.<br><br>
      ...but if the number is <span class="hey">exactly 6</span> You will get a 'Full Star' card, which has a black
      background, a white border
      and a 'Full Star' icon <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> next to Michi's name.<br>
      The probability of obtaining this type of card is 0.09% each time a Michi Card is created.

      <summary>Where is the data to create the Michi Card obtained from?</summary>
      This web project is created around different sources.<br>
      The gifs that load on the Home Page are obtained through the <a href="https://cataas.com/" target="_blank">CATAAS</a> API.<br>
      Random photos for the Card images are obtained using <a href="https://thecatapi.com/" target="_blank">The Cat API</a>.<br>
      The icons are part of the free <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>
      collections.<br>
      I found the <span class="hey">Cool kitten wearing sunglasses</span> many years ago on Google doing another project with cats. Currently I can't
      find its source.
      The initial loading animation was achieved thanks to <a href="https://animista.net/"
        target="_blank">animista.net</a>.
      And the font comes from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>
